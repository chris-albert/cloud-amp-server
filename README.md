# cloud-amp-server
Winamp for the cloud, the server

This project uses express.js as a very simple server for getting library data from various cloud music streams. 

Supported streaming services:
* Google Play Music

Would like to add spotify and others once the ui is done.

# Running the server locally

This project uses nvm to manage node versions, so to use the correct node version:
`nvm use`

Then to run use either
`node app.js`
or, if you want auto reload then use
`nodemon app.js`
